What's the Weather Like?
Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question:

"What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."

But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

WeatherPy
Create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Results:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
